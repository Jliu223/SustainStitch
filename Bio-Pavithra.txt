My name is Pavithra Govindhan Senthilmurugan. I am a freshman at Drexel University majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in learning more about the field of computer science and technology. Some of my skills include trouble-shooting when faced with high-pressure situations, resilience when it comes to solving problems, as well as good communication skills allowing me to perform efficiently in group settings. Other than Computer Science, some of my interests include running, working out in general, reading, spending time with friends, as well as traveling!
