        <p> 
          <div class="whatIsIt4">
            This website was made to bring awareness to the harsh impact that fast fashion has on the environment, community, and on people. Fast fashion has been a long-going issue that has nobody really talks about or makes an active effort to fix in comparison to other issues. We hope that this website will not only bring awareness to the issue, but allow people to realize the seriousness of this issue and make an active effort to become more sustainable.
